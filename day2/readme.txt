- Performance

# Why we use React
- DOM is slow in its real form
- React uses virtual DOM which is significatly faster and more effiecient to update
- simple and easy to learn
- Reusability
- Robust re-rendering with virtual DOM
- Native libraries
- Performace
- Easy testing

# Setup
- Nodejs
- VSCode


> npm i <package_name>
> npm i <package_name>@<version>

> npm i create-react-app -g   
> create-react-app --version
> create-react-app <project_name>
> cd <project_name>
> npm start

http://localhost:3000


or

# Understand folder structure
package.json - this is npm configuration file maintain by npm it includes information
               about the app meta data (app name, version) and list of dependencies

package-lock.json - this is an auto-generated file that gets updated whenever npm
                    does any opeartion

node_modules - this folder contain the dependencies source code 
> npm install

.gitignore - this file is used by git to ignore any file and folder while publishing
source code into remote server

README.md - used for writing some instructions

public - this folder contain the public assets it also contain index.html

src - source

there are 3 files which together form app / root component
App.css
App.js
App.test.js


index.css - global css 

index.js - it is main entry point of the app like main method


# Components in React
- in react a component represent a part of user interface
- what ever is visible on the web page is a component, we can put components
togther to make a bigger component
- component are reuable and make the application more moduler


# type of component
- class component
- functional component
